This function has appropriate defaults for height, width and plot resolution (dpi), so unless we explicitly want these to change, we can just ignore them from the function.\nTherefore to use this function to save a plot, all we need to do is provide the filepath of the location we want to save the plot, with the name of the plot. For example:\nJPackage::plot_save(filename = \"drive/folder/project/viz/CHANGE_NAME_TO_SOMETHING_SUITABLE.png\") Sometimes though, the default size of JPackage::plot_save() just won‚Äôt do. For example, you may have many topics from topic modelling and the top term plots all look a bit squished when they‚Äôre saved. In this case, you can try increasing the height and width of the plot by including those arguments such as:\nJPackage::plot_save(filename = \"drive/folder/project/viz/CHANGE_NAME_TO_SOMETHING_SUITABLE.png\", height = 9, width = 12) You have to play around with these values until you get a size of plot that is appropriate, üí° but remember to make all of the similar kind of plots the same size for deck/project consistency. üí°\nüéÅ Bonus Tip üéÅ Now, this works great for when we create and want to save a single plot. But for some of the workflows, we produce multiple plots at once (for example the bigrams during LDA topic modelling).\nTo perform this, we need to do some slightly more complex coding which applies a function (i.e.¬†JPackage::plot_save()) across a list or a vector. To show this, let‚Äôs pluck the bigrams from an LDA workflow:\nbigrams \u003c- ldas %\u003e% filter(k == 5, freq_cutoff == 200) %\u003e% SegmentR::explore_LDAs(top_terms = FALSE, diff_terms = FALSE, bigrams = TRUE, bigram_n = 25, exemplars = FALSE) %\u003e% pluck('bigrams', 1) This creates a list of the (in this case 5 [because we have filtered for k == 5]) bigrams. Each of these bigrams has a name, and what we can do is append perhaps the value of K onto each of these names using the following code:\nk_val \u003c- 5 # assign a numeric vector called k_val the value of 5 We can view the current names of the bigrams\nnames(bigrams) And then rename them with the appended k value:\nnames(bigrams) \u003c- paste0(names(bigrams), \"_\", \"k\", \"_\", k_val) Now we can apply JPackage::plot_save() to the list of bigrams using the function lapply().\nlapply(names(bigrams), function(x) JPackage::plot_save( dir = paste0(\"drive/folder/project/viz/bigrams_\", x, \".png\"), plot = bigrams[[x]] ) ) What each of these lines does is:\nlapply(names(bigrams) starts a loop that will iterate over the names of the objects in the bigrams list. Note, that if your bigrams list has a different name, it should be changed here too (i.e.¬†lapply(names(DIFFERENT_NAME))).\nfunction(x) is what is known as an anonymous function which takes a single argument known as x, which in this case is an individual name from the bigram list.\nJPackage::plot_save is the function that is called to save the plots\nfilename = paste0(\"drive/folder/project/viz/bigrams_\", x, \".png\") creates a file name for the saved plot abd saves these to the drive/folder/project/viz/ folder (which should be changed to something suitable) and names each bigram in this folder bigram_THE_NAME_OF_THE_BIGRAM.png.\nplot = bigrams[[x]] specifies the plot to be saved. The [[x]] notation retrieves the element of the bigrams list with name x. Again, if the bigram list has a different name, it should be changed here too (i.e.¬†plot = DIFFERENT_NAME[[x]]).\n",

<div id="the-problem" class="section level2">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>It is important to be able to export/save the figures created in R in a consistent manner, so that throughout a deck all plots of a similar type (e.g.¬†all bigrams) are the same size and resolution.</p>
<p>If plots are saved using the Plots panel by clicking <code>Export</code> and <code>Save as image</code>, it is very easy to accidentally save plots as different sizes (and you cannot alter the resolution from the default value).</p>

<p>The way to get around this is via the <code>ggsave()</code> function from the <code>ggplot2</code> library.</p>

<h2>üéÅ Bonus Tip üéÅ</h2>
<p>Now, this works great for when we create and want to save a single plot. But for some of the workflows, we produce multiple plots at once (for example the bigrams during LDA topic modelling).</p>
<p>To perform this, we need to do some slightly more complex coding which applies a function (i.e.¬†<code>JPackage::plot_save()</code>) across a list or a vector. To show this, let‚Äôs pluck the bigrams from an LDA workflow:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bigrams &lt;- ldas %&gt;%
  filter(k == 5, freq_cutoff == 200) %&gt;% 
  SegmentR::explore_LDAs(top_terms = FALSE,
                         diff_terms = FALSE,
                         bigrams = TRUE,
                         bigram_n = 25,
                         exemplars = FALSE) %&gt;%
  pluck(&#39;bigrams&#39;, 1)</code></pre>
<p>This creates a list of the (in this case 5 [because we have filtered for <code>k == 5</code>]) bigrams. Each of these bigrams has a name, and what we can do is append perhaps the value of K onto each of these names using the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>k_val &lt;- 5 # assign a numeric vector called k_val the value of 5</code></pre>
<p>We can view the current names of the bigrams</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(bigrams)</code></pre>
<p>And then rename them with the appended k value:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(bigrams) &lt;- paste0(names(bigrams), &quot;_&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;_&quot;, k_val) </code></pre>
<p>Now we can apply <code>JPackage::plot_save()</code> to the list of bigrams using the function <code>lapply()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lapply(names(bigrams),
       function(x) JPackage::plot_save(
         dir = paste0(&quot;drive/folder/project/viz/bigrams_&quot;, x, &quot;.png&quot;), 
         plot = bigrams[[x]]
         )
       )</code></pre>
<p>What each of these lines does is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>lapply(names(bigrams)</code> starts a loop that will iterate over the names of the objects in the bigrams list. Note, that if your bigrams list has a different name, it should be changed here too (i.e.¬†<code>lapply(names(DIFFERENT_NAME))</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>function(x)</code> is what is known as an anonymous function which takes a single argument known as <code>x</code>, which in this case is an individual name from the bigram list.</p></li>
<li><p><code>JPackage::plot_save</code> is the function that is called to save the plots</p></li>
<li><p><code>filename = paste0("drive/folder/project/viz/bigrams_", x, ".png")</code> creates a file name for the saved plot abd saves these to the <code>drive/folder/project/viz/</code> folder (which should be changed to something suitable) and names each bigram in this folder <code>bigram_THE_NAME_OF_THE_BIGRAM.png</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>plot = bigrams[[x]]</code> specifies the plot to be saved. The [[x]] notation retrieves the element of the bigrams list with name x. Again, if the bigram list has a different name, it should be changed here too (i.e.¬†<code>plot = DIFFERENT_NAME[[x]]</code>).</p></li>
</ul>
