#### *Topic originally suggested by Mike Tapp, Data Diretor*

## The Problem

Sometimes we need to update our packages, perhaps new functions have been added, patches have been included to fix bugs. 

We can update packages in a few ways:

## Using R script

If we know a specific package that needs to be updated, we can run the code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("PACKAGE_NAME")
```

So for example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

*Note the quotation marks surrounding the package name*

## Using the R Package Manager

An easier way to update multiple packages is through the Packages window of R Studio (which by default is in the bottom right hand corner), there is an "*Update*" button, which you can click to give you a list of packages that are ready to be updated. 

<center>
![](/update_packages.png){width=70%}
</center>

From there, we can click "*Select All*" and click "*Install Updates*".

<center>
![](/update_packages_2.png){width=70%}
</center>

We will then normally be told that R will be restarted during this process. This is ***normally*** okay and R should save everything you are working on- but just in case I would recommend making sure you have everything saved yourself- to be safe. 

## To update Share packages

To update the Share packages we can't use the Packages pane (as they are hosted privately for us). Therefore to update these packages as and when required (*The DS team will put out a message advising updating when appropriate*), we run the same code we originally used to install them in the first place.

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github(repo = "Avery-Island/ParseR",
                         auth_token = "let_me_in_please",
                         force = TRUE)

devtools::install_github(repo = "Avery-Island/SegmentR",
                         auth_token = "let_me_in_please",
                         force = TRUE)

devtools::install_github(repo = "Avery-Island/ConnectR",
                         auth_token = "let_me_in_please",
                         force = TRUE)

devtools::install_github(repo = "Avery-Island/HelpR",
                         auth_token = "let_me_in_please",
                         force = TRUE)
```

Here we just need to make sure we change the `auth_token = "let_me_in_please"` line to our authentication token that you received from Mike when you first downloaded the package.

ðŸš¨As an aside, once a package has been installed once (through `install.packages("PACKAGE_NAME")`, we do not need to install it again. It is saved in a directory called "library" in our R environment. Therefore to use these packages in future R sessions, we only need to load them using `library(PACKAGE_NAME)`ðŸš¨
