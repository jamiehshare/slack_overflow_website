## The Problem

When trying to plot a visualisation (e.g. bigrams), you are greeted with the following error message:

![Type of error message we may see](img/error_message.png){width=50%}

This is an issue with R being unable to find the appropriate fonts to produce our plot.

## The Solution- reinstall fonts and restart R session.

We need to make sure we have the correct fonts installed on our computers, and also imported into R.

The fonts that we need to make sure we have installed are:  
- "Neue Haas Grotesk Text Pro 55 Roman"
- "Neue Haas Grotesk Text Pro 65 Medium"
- "Neue Haas Grotesk Text Pro 75 Bold".

We can check this by opening up our Font Book application on our Macs. To do this, press âŒ˜ + space and type "Font Book", and it should appear. We can then double check that these fonts appear:

<center>

</center>

If we do not have these fonts, they can be downloaded from [enter link here]().

Now, we can run the following code in R to rebook our fonts and make sure all of our system fonts (from Font Book) are imported into R.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(extrafont)
font_import()
loadfonts()
```

Now a quick reboot of R (you can do this by clicking the "Session" from the RStudio menu bar and choosing "Restart R") should enable you to continue plotting to your hearts content.

**N.B. Before restarting R, make sure you save any large datasets (e.g. ldas, explore object) and/or scripts you may be working on! As a recommendation, save the datasets as an `.rds` file using the `readr::write_rds()` function**
